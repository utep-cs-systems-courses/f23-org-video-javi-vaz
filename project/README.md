## MINI PIANO ART



This program turns the MSP 430 into a piano that plays 4 notes depending on

the button pressed. The first button is for C, the second for D, the third for

E, and the fourth for F. Additionally, each button draws two circles on the screen.



Moreover, the LED connected to BIT6 turns on when the CPU is off. This
decision was made to make visualizing the sleep easier because otherwise the
LED would only be on for a little bit. 



## HOW TO RUN



With the device connected, in the terminal run " make load " and after a

second the user should be able to play to their heart's content.
